> The praise of virtue is the praise of some private harm - it is praise of impulses which deprive a man of his noblest selfishness, and the strength to take the greatest care of himself.

This is exactly what I learned about virtue and morality growing up in church and Christian culture. It felt like the ultimate good was to sacrifice yourself to a greater cause. We were praised for our sacrifice more than anything else. The more one sacrificed themselves, the more "virtuous" or holy they were.

I certainly got caught up in this. It seemed like a competition, though no one within the church called it what it was. The people that "served" the most -- in the most church sanctioned ministries/activities -- were the most recognized for their selflessness.

Equating selflessness with self-sacrifice -- holding up self-sacrifice as the highest virtue -- does so much harm, though, to the individual.

> We honour a youth while regretting the fact that he 'worked his fingers to the bone', because we judge: 'For society as a whole, even the loss of the best individual is but a small sadcrifice! What a pity that sacrifice is needed! Much worse, however, should the individual think otherwise, and regard his own preservation and development as more important than his service to society.'

But is it really best for society as a whole for each of its members to consider every other member more imporant than themselves? Is that a sustainable calculus? We acknowledge the opposite is more sustainable, yet not carried through because there is less to show for ourselves:

> We might perhaps consider whether it would not have been more useful to society if he had worked with less self-neglect, and preserved himself longer -- of course we readily admit the advantage in that, but reply that the other advantage -- namely that a _sacrifice_ has been made, and that our attitude towards, and treatment of, the sacrificial animal has once again been _conspicuously_ confirmed -- is more important and makes a more lasting impression.

Is that the reason self-sacrifice is held in such high regard in our culture? (Not just in religious communities, I think. I've observed the same sentiment in other spaces of my life, too.) Because it makes a more lasting impression? That would make sense. It certainly does leave a "more lasting impression". And I've observed in myself (to the present day) _guilt_ and _shame_ when choosing to say "no" to something that I don't want to do (because I don't believe it's part of what I'm here to do, or it would ultimately be to serve someone else's goals rather than my own... among other reasons), since it would make me look good if I said "yes".

> ...in short, the unreasonableness in virtue whereby the individual allows himself to be converted into a function of the larger whole.

We've ended up concluding that "public virtue and private advantage go hand in hand..." That what's best for society is what's best for the individual.

He says this a bit in passing, but it resonated with me: that this ethic causes the one who holds it to lead "a humble and thoughtless life, perhaps even an indifferent or ironical one..." In short: it's paralyzing and compounded further through the teaching of human depravity (in the church). Every impulse gets micro-scrutinized, and we're not equipped or taught to think through the subtlety of how something could be both best for us (the individual) and also best for the world, or society as a whole.

It's not until one becomes an individual that they can be filled with _passion_. I think it's the passion many of us fear though, because it may lead us to do things that appear selfish.
