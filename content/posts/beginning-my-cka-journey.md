The title of this is a little misleading. My journey actually started last year with a CKA course in O'Reilly offered by Sander van Vugt. It took me through bootstrapping my own cluster, and helped me get more familiar with a lot of Kubernetes basics such as troubleshooting, getting confortable with using kubectl, DaemonSets, ConfigMaps & Secrets, ReplicaSets, Labels, and managing storage, among other things. There came a point in the course, though, where I felt like we were rushing through things, and the teaching style wasn't really working for me.

I've since been dragging my feet a bit, though it's recently become more clear I really want get my CKA and hone in on my Kube skills. So I've decided to move on to a [course offered in Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) that was highly rated by a bunch of resources I came across. I'm looking forward to diving in.

Other things I've recently worked on:
* Bootstrapping a new cluster for practice, using [this guide](https://www.oueta.com/linux/create-a-debian-11-kubernetes-cluster-with-kubeadm/).
* Deploying the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) to it.

I'm hoping to add regular posts here documenting my journey--and struggles--along the way.
