Notes & Quotes from _'Jest, Trick and Revenge' - Prelude in German Rhymes_.
> 4\. _Dialogue_  
>
> A: I was sick and then got better?  
> I don't even know my doctor!  
> How could I forget all that?  
> B: Only now do you recover:  
> Health returns when you forget.  

Is he saying: "There are some beliefs (such as religious beliefs) that damage us so greatly, one can only recover from them by distancing oneself from them, to the point where one forgets them entirely." Spending so much time with the Bible that it takes several years of not reading it, and not attending church, to start forgetting at the celular level.

> 5\. _To the Virtuous_  
>
> Our virtues ought to dash, and so,  
> Like Homer's verse, should come _and go_!  

It's common to think of virtues as timeless and unchanging. Whereas, what if they were meant to be malleable? What if our virtues need to be dashed from time to time, to be reborn?

> 7\. _Vademecum -- Vadetecum_  
> 
> Attracted by my style and voice,  
> You would follow after me?  
> Walk your own path faithfully,  
> And -- bit by bit -- become like me.  

Almost seems like something Jesus could've said. "If you really want to be like me, don't follow me. Follow no one. Walk your own path, and you'll become what you admire about me." Setting up leaders for ourselves -- people to follow and admire -- tends to lead to blind faith. We should be helping people become themselves, rather than making them our followers. The unfortunate side of social media.

> 14\. _The Brave and True_  
>
> Sooner whole hostility  
> Than pieced-together amity!  

Give me someone who is sincere in their hostility toward me, rather than an insincere friendship. Give me hot or cold, rather than lukewarm, sort of thing.

> 18\. _Narrow Souls_  
>  
> Narrow souls are odious:  
> Good or bad, they scarce possess.  

What restrictive religious culture can do. Create narrow souls that possess neither good or bad.

> 24\. _Antidote to Pessimism_  
> \[...\]  
> Take a tip from me, my friend,  
> And wisely follow this suggestion,  
> Every morning eat a toad -  
> I'll bet that cures your indigestion!  

Gaining perspective on life. No need to "rant and rave." Life is good and sometimes you just need to experience something nasty to understand!

> 33\. _The Unfree_
>
> A. Is he deceived in what he hears?  
> What's that ringing in his ears?  
> What struck him down and laid him low?  
> B. If chains were once all he did know,  
> Then chains are all he'll ever hear.  

Reminds me of a comic I saw from nakedpastor on IG. Person A: "You do realize you could just walk straight out of there!" addressing person in a cage with bars big enough to walk through. Person B: "What makes you think I'd want to do that?"

From No. 33 _The Recluse_ - "I hate still more the task of self-command!" Because it's burdensome? A lot of work? We do tend to put a lot of energy into "self-command". "I love to lose myself for just a day, to sit and muse, to lead my thoughts astray..." But that's not all. Eventually, a return: "And when at length my home I yearn to see, I coax myself and then return to me."

> 37\. _Caution_  
>  
> Sojourning in those parts is rather hard,  
> If you have brains, you must be on your guard!  
> First they adore you, then tear you to shreds,  
> Devotees haven't a brain in their heads!  

Like being immersed in church culture, then becoming yourself. Like going through "deconstruction". They tear you to shreds for changing and growing.

> 53\. _Human, All Too Human_. A Book
>  
> As long as you dwell on the past,  
> you're filled with doubt and sorrow.  
> As long as you trust in yourself,  
> then you trust in tomorrow...

No. 61 - _The Sceptic Speaks_. Vainly seeking meaning when their is no meaning. "What more do you hope to discover? Just this: to know what the whole thing was about!"
