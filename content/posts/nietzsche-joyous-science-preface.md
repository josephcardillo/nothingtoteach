The first line of the preface made me laugh:

> Perhaps more than one preface would be necessary for this book; and after all it might still be doubtful whether anyone could be brought nearer to the _experiences_ in it by means of prefaces, without having himself experienced something similar. (7)

As though he were saying: all the prefaces in the world wouldn't be enough to understand this book. One must experience self-emancipation for themself.

I'm just starting this, so I only have an idea what it's about (i.e - self-actualization, self-emancipation). If that's accurate, this first line rings very true. That one has to go on the journey to understand it.

> The whole book is really nothing but a revel after a long privation and sense of powerlessness: a rejoicing in the return of strength, in newly awakened belief in a tomorrow and day after tomorrow, in sudden sentiment and presentiment of a future, in approaching adventures, in seas open once more, and aims once more permitted and believed in. (7)

This is such a beautiful sentence. The journey leads to light-heartedness and adventure. (And to humor?) It accurately describes (to me) the feeling of coming out of a constrictive belief system into a wider, more inclusive, joyful, fun, permissive and _free_ worldview. The "adventure" of finding one's freedom and coming alive.

> ...and I have often wondered whether on the whole philosophy has thus far really been only an interpretation of the body, and a _misunderstanding of the body_. Concealed behind the most exalted value judgements that have governed the history of thought so far lie misunderstandings of physicality, either of individuals, classes, or entire races. (9-10)

Religious supression (while often unintentional) is rooted in suppression of physicality. In suppression of the body. Personally, I learned through church (and religious teaching) that pleasure is suspect and the body not to be trusted. That we should always be suspect of pleasure (in anything) being too strong.

Looking back, nothing seems more absurd than to teach one to be suspicious of the physical world, our senses, inclinations, desires, and most of all: our body.

> In the end, it is great pain only which liberates the spirit; for it teaches a _great suspicion_ which reveals the apparently genuine to be counterfeit, makes a known quantity into an unknown one, and, in solving that equation, prepares us for an ultimate decision ... (11)

"Great pain liberates the spirit." If he's referring to the pain of self-emancipation: yes, 100%. Questioning beliefs causes pain. Leaving what is familiar causes great pain. Stepping into the unknown causes pain. Yet it teaches us to see the true from the counterfeit. "The truth will set you free."

> ...one emerges from such long, dangerous exercises in self-mastery as another person, with a few more question marks, above all _determined_ to keep questioning, more profoundly, strictly, sternly, wickedly and discreetly than ever before. (11)

It does feel like a re-birth, in a sense. Is it possible this is the truer definition of being "born-again"? Re-birth as a new, free person?

> ...we know a new happiness. (11)

> ..._reborn_, with skin shed; more ticklish, more mischievous, with a finer taste for delight, with a more delicate palate for all good things, with a more blithesome disposition, with a second and more dangerous innocence in delight, at the same time more childish and a hundred times more sophisticated than before. (12)

Senses reawakened. Becoming child-like. Embracing _life_ in all its forms. Not judging. The very things Jesus emhasized and taught, ironically.

This kind of freedom can feel threatening to those around us. We can even be afraid of it ourselves, because it means we have to make our own decisions and take responsibility for our own lives.
