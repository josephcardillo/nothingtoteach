By "intellectual conscience" I think he means: thinking for oneself rather than group-think.

I thought this was interesting:

> I mean to say: _the majority_ do not find it contemptible to believe this or that, and live accordingly, _without_ ascertaining in advance what speaks for and against it, and without even bothering to do so after the fact.

This is what I did for most of my life. In my experience, this is true for more religious/conservative circles because there's a built in skepticism and fear of questioning beliefs. Perhaps why I've leaned more and more liberal over the past decade, because there's more openness to questioning?

I remember feeling this most intensely in my late-teens/early-twenties:

> ...the demand for certainty their innermost desire and profoundest need...

I wanted morality and ethics to be black-and-white. I _needed_ it to be.

Some of this sentence gives me chills:

> But to stand in the midst of this _rerum concordia discors_ and all the wonderful uncertainty and ambiguity of life, _and not question_, not to tremble with curiosity and the passion for enquiry, not even to hate those who do -- perhaps even to find them mildly amusing -- that is what I feel to be _contemptible_, and it is this sentiment which I first look for in everyone -- some foolishness never fails to persuade me that every man as such has this sentiment.

Does this sentiment exist in everyone? If so, how repressed is it in some people? What does it take to smoke this out? How much poking and prodding? How much pain, hurt, or loss does one need to experience before the "demand for certainty" cracks?

How does one "stand in the midst" of nature's jarring discord and _not_ have questions?
