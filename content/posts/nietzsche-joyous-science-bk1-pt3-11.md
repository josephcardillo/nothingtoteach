I'm imagining Nietzsche flipping tables in his reader's minds. Taking a wide-angle view at perspectives and ideas we take for granted. Some selections from sections 3 through 11.

**3\. The Noble and Common**

The common view the sentiments and actions of the noble with suspicion. The noble assume their generosity is selfless and well-meaning, whereas the common view it as, "Their must be some secret advantage I'm not aware of. Why would they purposely _disadvantage_ themselves?" Or they view the noble as fools. Having a "Disease of reason". At the same time, the noble don't understand the common.

> It is very rare that a higher nature has enough sense to see everyday human beings for what they are and treat them accordingly: at the very most he believes in his passion as the hidden passion of all, and in this faith he is especially full of fervour and eloquence. Now if such exceptional men do not feel themselves to be exceptions, how can they ever hope to understand the common natures and obtain a fair assessment of the norm? (38)

**4\. That Which Preserves the Species**

It's not simply good-will that preserves our species, but "The strongest and most evil minds have thus far advanced mankind the most..." He lumps "every teacher and preacher of some _innovation_" in their, too, because it's innovation "which wants to conquer".

> ...whatever preserves the species is called good, whatever harms it is called evil. In truth, the evil impulses are every bit as expedient, indispensable and conducive to the preservation of the species as the good -- they just have a different function.

**7\. Something for the Industrious**

We (in the Christian west, at least) tend to think of morality as mostly in Either/Or, black-and-white terms. Here, though, he humorously points out how complicated it would really be to apply oneself to "a study of moral matters". Lots of funny stuff in this section. For example:

> So far all that has given colour to existence still has no history: where would you find a history of love, of avarice, of envy, of conscience, of piety, of cruelty? ... Have the various ways of dividing the day, the consequences of appointing regular times for labour, rest and festival, ever been made the subject of investigation? Do we know the moral effects of foods? Is there a philosophy of nutrition? (The perpetual hue and cry for and against vegetarianism proves that there is still no such philosophy!) (41)

**11\. Consciousness**

Consciousness hasn't fully developed because we misunderstand it. And perhaps for the better, as far as preservation of our species goes.

> Before a function is fully formed and mature, it is a danger to the organism...

In other words, if we think of consciousness as "the _pith and marrow_ of a human being, the part that is most pristine, final, everlasting and eternal," as "the 'unity of the organism'", it prevents consciousness "from developing too rapidly".

Maybe I'm superimposing my modern perspective here, but this one stuck out to me with how much we talk about becoming aware, "woke", conscious in our culture. That, in one sense, many of us have traded one kind of fundamentalism for another. That what we call "becoming aware" is often just the discovery of the antithesis to what we've believed. Still functionally operating as though the two sides, good and evil, were pitted against one another.

This energy of good and evil, from both the preacher and the tyrant, the common and the noble, religion and science, love and avatism (which he gets into later), is the energy of creation and destruction that has helped preserve our species. But what if there were something (what he's calling consciousness?) that transcends these Either/Ors? Something that "transcends and includes" them? 

> It is only just dawning upon us that we have an entirely new and scarecely recognizeable _task, to make what we know a part of us_, to make it instinctive -- a task seen only by those who understand that so far only our _errors_ have become a part of us, that being conscious pertains to nothing but errors!

This seems very _Tao_. This absorbing of our own errors. I think human nature (not exclusive to Christianity?) is to resist in ourselves what we view as evil, or what we are told is wrong. Whereas, in order to grow, in order to become "conscious", we have to make our errors a part of us.
