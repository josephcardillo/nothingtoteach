Notes & Quotes from Book 1, Pt. 1 _The Teachers of the Purpose of Life_

All men, whether good or evil, have one aim in life: "the preservation of the human race." An interesting proposition. This reminds me of how the Left views the Right as evil, and _vice versa_, yet the aim of both is the same. They both believe their policies and values are what's necessary for human prospering and preservation. The same applies to the religious and the atheists and everywhere in between. They all have the same end in mind.

Good and evil mean such different things to different people. Is starting here a way of circumventing the whole argument over morals?

He uses the word _laugh_/_laughter_ a lot. As though the antithesis to laughter is taking ourselves too seriously and thinking we mean more than we do. Needing to create a reason to live. Saying, "Life _should_ be loved, _because_!" Tragedy as a means to self-preservation.

> Man has gradually become a fanciful animal, who has one more condition of existence to fulfil than other animals: from time to time, man _must_ think he knows _why_ he exists; the human race cannot flourish without periodically renewed trust in life! Without believing in the _reason in life_!" (35)

The weightiness of the religious world-view. Doing everything _right_. At least, that's what I experiened. This great weight to get it all right. Because so much was at stake...
