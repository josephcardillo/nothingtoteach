"Avarice and love... the same impulse twice named..."

Once again, challenging our basic understanding of something so common: _love_.

Avarice - _(I had to look this up)_ "Extreme greed for wealth". It seems like Nietzsche is suggesting our common/collective definition of love is a desire to possess. We want something or someone. We say we love it. We get it. Then once we've possessed it, our love for it fades and we eventually desire something/someone new.

> ...what is had loses much in the having. Our pleasure in ourselves thus seeks to sustain itself by continually transforming something new _into ourselves_ -- that is just what possession means. To grow weary with a possession is to grow weary with ourselves.

Reminds me of the character No-Face from _Spirited Away_. Love as a consuming force, transforming things/people around us into ourselves as a way to sustain pleasure in ourselves.

This possessiveness is most clearly displayed (or "betrayed") in "the love of the sexes". Lovers want exclusive access to one another, not realizing "this means nothing less than to _exclude_ the whole world from a precious commodity, and from the happiness and enjoyment it affords..."

> Still more astonishing is the fact that the concept of love as the opposite of selfishness has always been modelled on it, when it is perhaps precisely the most candid expression of selfishness!

This is something Rache and I have been talking a lot about over the last month. Re-reading our vows and asking ourselves, "If we were writing these today, how would they be different? What does it mean to have been married in the eyes of the Church, when we no longer experience life in the Church?" The things we said in our vows were primarily focussed on promises. "I promise to do this..." and "I promise to not do that..." A promise to be faithful and exclusive. Whereas today we'd probably focus more on our commitment to one another to help each other grow and transform into our fully-human, authenticate and creative-selves. To help one another on our journey toward freedom.

In other words, we don't think we'd make it about promises of exclusivity as much as our commitment to grow together in partnership, for as long as it was good (and necessary?) for both of us.

This seems to get more at what Nietzsche concludes with, regarding friendship (if I'm reading this right):

> Arguably, here and there on earth one comes across a couple in whom one sees a continuation of sorts to love's avaricious appetite, in whom it has given way to a new desire and new avarice, to a _shared_ thirst for an exalted ideal far above them; but who knows this love? Who has experienced it? Its proper name is _friendship_.

Reminded us of college. Spending time with a lot of people and enjoying a lot of beautiful friendships. Then observing in our friends -- and eventually in ourselves -- people hitching up, becoming exclusive, watching friendships fade away.

We've asked ourselves: what would it have looked like to do that differently? Practicing relinquishing _control_ over one another. Opening ourselves up to the world again, others, new friendships. Trusting ourselves and each other and no longer equating love with _exclusivity_. Moving away from fear and distrust of self, into a deeper trust.

Ironically learning that this letting go of control and exclusivity leads into deeper relationship, too. That one must let go of possessiveness in love in order to experience deeper communion.
