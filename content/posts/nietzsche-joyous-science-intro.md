Started reading Nietzsche's "The Joyous Science". Here are my notes/quotes from the introduction that stood out.

> Accordingly, the conditions for flourishing and self-actualization will vary widely from one person to the next. This in turn means that individuals cannot rely unthinkingly on their own socialization or inherited traditions in order to determine how best to actualize their own potential, since the customs and traditions in question are not sufficiently tailored to the individual case. Consequently, the discovery of the means to self-actualization must be left to the individual's own experimentation. Second, precisely because social customs and inherited traditions are geared to collective flourishing, they tend to demand self-sacrifice from the individual and can even be quite harmful. (xiv)

It's easy to fear the process of "self-actualization", having grown up in a religious culture/environment. Because it means stepping outside of safety. Beyond what is known. However, self-actualization isn't possible without going on an individual journey. "Experimentation" is not encouraged in religious circles because it threatens the social safety net. There's also the "slippery slope" argument that's often put forth to discourage self-actualization.

> 273
> _Whom Do You Call Bad?_
> Those who always want to put others to shame.
>
> 274
> _What Is Most Humane?_
> To spare someone shame.
>
> 275
> _What is the Seal of Liberation?_
> To no longer be ashamed of oneself. (xvi)

Such simplicity.

Contrast between who Christians would call "bad" (i.e. - sinners) and Nietzsche's definition: "Those who always want to put others to shame" (a/k/a - the religious gatekeepers). Shame puts people in bondage and doesn't lead to freedom. Whereas, being spared shame makes it possible to experience freedom in the first place.

I think it's interesting that he says the seal of liberation is "to no longer be ashamed of oneself". Based on my experience, and through observation, the irony of religious shame is that it seems to be the very thing that pushes people further into "sin", whereas learning to be free from shame is actually what has the power to liberate people from the bondage of "sin".

> Life is to be _loved_. (xvii)

> Nietzsche radicalizes a common secular thought that, in the absence of an afterlife, we must make the most of this life, for this life is all we have. Matters for him are more extreme: this life is _inescapable_. If its ending provides any solace to the weary, that solace is illusory, for as soon as you end this life you must (subjectively speaking) start it over again from the beginning. (xviii-xix)

I'm not sure I'm totally understanding this yet, though it seems like the intro is getting at Nietzsche's "eternal recurrence". A thought experiment, that if there's no afterlife, we should be asking ourselves the questions: Am I affirming life completely? Is the life I'm living now worthy to be lived over and over again?
